# MatchingCardGame
A matching card game celebrating the history of Durags and their Champions

All fun and games. Working hard on utlization of JavaScript Conditionals and making a game capable of scale the more effort I put into  it.
A simple four square match for quick matches and a tracking system for you loses over time. My plan is to add a timer.
